# Dev-friendly cafés in Patras
With more and more remote workers in Patras, we've been hearing more and more often the question:

"Hey, know of any cafés that are good options as a work environment?"

As a developer in Patras, I feel that we should have an answer or more!!

Please feel free to suggest your favourite café by opening a PR or by filing a new issue, so that the collected info can be presented to the public.

# List of cafés ☕

* **Yachting House, Vrachnaiika** - https://goo.gl/maps/r8YAGfDNviFXfDjU7: 
Quiet cafe in the off-season, rich food menu, sometimes laggy Wi-Fi, but they do provide a power socket extension if you ask. Very nice view and easy parking.

* **Moxy Patra Marina, Patras** - https://g.page/moxypatra?share: 
The ground floor is quiet where a big table can fit 6-7 developers. Power plugs are embedded to said table. The Wi-Fi is pretty good and you can ask at the reception for the access code. Also, you can buy yourself some breakfast, it is served til 10:30.
