# Dev-friendly caf√©s in Patras
With more and more remote workers in Patras, we've been hearing more and more often the question:

"Hey, know of any caf√©s that are good options as a work environment?"

As a developer in Patras, I feel that we should have an answer or more!!

Please feel free to suggest your favourite caf√© by opening a PR or by filing a new issue, so that the collected info can be presented to the public.

# List of caf√©s ‚òï

* **Yachting House, Vrachnaiika** - https://goo.gl/maps/r8YAGfDNviFXfDjU7: 
Quiet cafe in the off-season, rich food menu, sometimes laggy Wi-Fi, but they do provide a power socket extension if you ask. Very nice view and easy parking.
